# SpiderBox Design Ruby on Rails Assessment
### THE URL SHORTENER CHALLENGE

Your mission is to make a URL shortener full-stack application using any database engine, Ruby On Rails, (bonus points if the frontend is a SPA in ReactJS).
Create one repo if you work entirely with RoR, or two repos if you work with Rails + React. Send us the links of both repositories.

+kudos If you use docker, that would be great and give extra points.



### CORE REQUIREMENTS
- As a visitor, I want to create an account for the app, so that I become an active user.
    Acceptance Criteria:
      - Application needs my name, email, and password.
      - Duplicated emails are not allowed.
      - Validates email input.
- As an active user I must be able to put a URL into the home page and get back a URL of the shortest possible length.

      AC:
        - You shouldn't use any gem or library that provides the short url algorithm
        - Inputting a valid URL should result in displaying the new shortened URL to the user.
        - Inputting an invalid URL should result in displaying errors to the user.

- As an active user I must be able to manage my links, edit, create, destroy, etc.

- As an active user, every time I share this link, I must be redirected to the full URL when we enter the short URL (ex: [http://app.com/aSdF](http://app.com/aSdF)​ =>​ [​https://google.com​](​https://google.com​)).
- As an active user I want to see a list of my links, ordered by creation date.
- As an active user I want to click on my links to see details and stats.

      AC:
        - I want to see how many times my link was clicked.

- There must be a README that explains how to set up the application and the algorithm used for generating the URL shortcode.

- As an active user I want an API key to access and integrate any other platform with this shortener.

      AC:
        - I want an endpoint to access all my links.
        - All endpoint results must be paginated.
        - I want an endpoint to shorten new URLs.

- Bonus point if you test all your code with RSpec.


> \* Research and understand how [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly) and [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/) work before you decide on how to generate URLs of the shortest possible length.
There must be a view for the Top 100 most frequently accessed URLs.
